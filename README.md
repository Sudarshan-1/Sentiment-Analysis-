# Sentiment-Analysis-
Using Python

- Conducted sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon Fine Food Reviews using two distinct techniques: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and a pretrained Roberta model.
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Transformers, and Seaborn for data manipulation, text processing, and visualization.
- Explored and visualized the distribution of review scores using bar plots, gaining insights into customer sentiments.
- Employed NLTK to tokenize, tag, and analyze parts of speech in text data, enhancing text processing skills.
- Leveraged VADER's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to generate sentiment scores for each review, including positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
- Utilized a pretrained transformer model, "twitter-roberta-base-sentiment," to predict sentiment scores and classify reviews into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments.
- Developed a custom function to process text data, apply the pretrained model, and compute sentiment scores, demonstrating coding proficiency and familiarity with deep learning techniques.
- Merged sentiment scores from both VADER and the Roberta model into a single DataFrame, allowing for comprehensive comparison and analysis of results.
- Conducted a comparative analysis of sentiment scores from VADER and the Roberta model using visualizations such as pair plots, providing insights into model performance and discrepancies.
- Identified and presented instances where sentiment scores differed significantly from actual review scores, showcasing critical thinking and attention to model limitations.
- Showcased proficiency in utilizing the Hugging Face Transformers library's sentiment analysis pipeline for quick sentiment predictions, highlighting adaptability and utilization of pre-built tools.
